# MakemoreStudy
Random repo where I studied Karpathy's Makemore tutorials from [here](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&si=cgWIzABgxr3rYXx1)

I spent a whole week working through the tutorials, as I was beginning my ML grind on March 2024.
Tutorials went through the basics of backprop, simple nets, tensor operations, transformers and attention.

My code is untested and I rather recommend going through the original series and writing the code yourself. I posted the cody only as a reference and memory, as it was the first deep dive into tensors, numpy and pytorch.
